# GAME-Gregs-Defender
a non-basic tower defence
this game is similar to other tower defence games except in some special cases.

1) there is no set path, attackers will (except in special cases) take the fastest, most direct route.
2) defence is not from towers but from mobile, organic defenders.
  a) a horde of bandits will bunch up and charge the village, 
  b) the defending village warriors will 
    - man the defence towers, field artillary and traps 
    - arm themselves with weapons & armour to face the attackers directly.

attackers and defenders may or may not be human. Other races will be available as attackers and defenders can make mutual defence alliances thus gaining new units for their own defence.

weapons, armour and fixed units will have many many versions, upgrades and types
characters (both sides) can be of any race and class
defenders can level up and multiclass

so think of this less as tower defence and more of clash of clans meets D&D and no massive multiplayer.
