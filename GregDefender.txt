1) Overview
****************************************************************

	Greg's Defender is (go figure) a wave-defender style game but with a lot of advancements and hundreds of new options that have never been seen in wave-defender style games before.  Based in a medieval/fantasy setting, our hero (player) must defend the village from waves of monsters eagerly seeking to rend/eat the innocents living in ignorant bliss of the worlds evils.  Should our Hero succeed, those innocents shall never know fear or suffer grousome deaths that these monsters promise to provide.  Should our Hero fail he WILL have to hear the screams of men, women & children as they are torn apart limb by bloody limb.	

	However, our Hero is not alone in this Mission of Mercy.  Between waves of monsters, he has the opportunity to build a small army of trained warriors, hired wizards and questing priests to help battle the forces of evil.  He doesn't even have to pay for it all.  Every Round between waves, the village offers a stipend of 2gp per living villager to the Hero for his expences and fees of running an army.  Also, every 5 rounds (including the initial round as a deposit) the local lord offers 150 gp as payment for services rendered. The Hero cannot pocket this money as he WILL need to train, upgrade and outfit his soldiers/archers/scouts as well as pay the fees/expenses for magical services from war wizards and finally offer tithes and donations to priests for their protections & healing arts.

	The Hero may purchase weapons, armour and other necessities (magic or mundane) from the trading caravan which arrives in town every 4 rounds (including the 1st round) but he must pay the unjustified prices and taxes levied by the trading guilds to do so.  However he may also commission weapons, Armour and other objects from the village craftspeople for a discounted price, tax free but must wait for the production cycle to end for his orders to be complete.  Faster cycles for cheaper items.

	Prices also change based on the price & availability of materials.  The Hero may offer to keep an inventory of materials as well as stock a warehouse of weapons & armour.  There's nothing wrong with building a trading company while he's at it. someone, somewhere wants to buy all that salvage the monsters leave behind.

	Combat is pretty easy, the bad guys start some distance from the outskirts of town with a leader (or not) and the good guys start at the gates to the town.
